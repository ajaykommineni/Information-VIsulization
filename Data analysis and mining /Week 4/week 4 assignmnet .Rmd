#Exercises
#1. Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion  p of voters are Democrats and  1−p  are Republicans. Your sample size is  N=25.Consider the random variable  S  which is the total number of Democrats in your sample. What is the expected value of this random variable? Hint: it’s a function of  p
 .
```{r}
# Set the sample size
N <- 25  # Number of voters in the sample

# Set the assumed proportion of Democrats in the population
p <- 0.6  # You can change this value to any probability between 0 and 1

# Calculate the expected value of the number of Democrats in the sample
# Since this follows a Binomial distribution, E[S] = N * p
expected_value <- N * p
cat("Expected number of Democrats (E[S]):", expected_value, "\n")

# Simulate one random sample using the binomial distribution
# rbinom(n, size, prob) generates 'n' samples from Binomial(size, prob)
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility of results
sample <- rbinom(1, size = N, prob = p)  # One random draw from Binomial(25, 0.6)

# Print the number of Democrats found in this simulated sample
cat("Simulated number of Democrats in one sample:", sample, "\n")

```

#2. What is the standard error of  S? Hint: it’s a function of  p
 .
```{r}
# Sample size
N <- 25

# Proportion of Democrats in the population
p <- 0.6  # You can change this to other values like 0.5, 0.3, etc.

# Calculate the standard error of S
# SE = sqrt(N * p * (1 - p))
standard_error <- sqrt(N * p * (1 - p))

# Print the result
cat("Standard error of S:", standard_error, "\n")

```

#3 Consider the random variable  S/NThis is equivalent to the sample average, which we have been denoting as  ¯X. What is the expected value of the  ¯X ? Hint: it’s a function of  p
 .
```{r}
# Sample size
N <- 25

# True proportion of Democrats in the population
p <- 0.6

# Expected value of the sample proportion X̄ = S / N
expected_X_bar <- p  # Because E[S]/N = (N*p)/N = p

# Print the expected value of the sample average
cat("Expected value of sample proportion (E[X̄]):", expected_X_bar, "\n")

```
#4 What is the standard error of ¯X? Hint: it’s a function of  p
```{r}
# Sample size
N <- 25

# Proportion of Democrats in the population
p <- 0.6  # Change as needed

# Standard error of sample proportion X̄ = sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)
se_X_bar <- sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)

# Print the result
cat("Standard error of sample proportion (SE[X̄]):", se_X_bar, "\n")

```

#5Write a line of code that gives you the standard error se for the problem above for several values of, specifically for p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100). Make a plot of se versus p.
```{r}
# Set sample size
N <- 25

# Create a sequence of p values from 0 to 1 (100 points)
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# Compute standard error for each p using the formula: sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)
se <- sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)

# Plot SE vs. p
plot(p, se, type = "l",                      # Line plot
     main = "Standard Error of X̄ vs p",     # Title
     xlab = "p (Proportion of Democrats)",   # x-axis label
     ylab = "Standard Error of X̄",          # y-axis label
     col = "blue", lwd = 2)                  # Line color and thickness

```
#6. Copy the code above and put it inside a for-loop to make the plot for  N=25 ,  N=100, and  N=1000.
```{r}
# Define the values of N to loop through
N_values <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Create a sequence of p values from 0 to 1
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# Set up the plot canvas
plot(p, sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N_values[1]), type = "n",  # Empty plot setup
     ylim = c(0, 0.12),                               # Adjust y-axis to fit all curves
     xlab = "p (Proportion of Democrats)",
     ylab = "Standard Error of X̄",
     main = "Standard Error vs p for Different Sample Sizes")

# Define colors for each curve
colors <- c("blue", "green", "red")

# Loop through each N value and plot the SE curve
for (i in 1:length(N_values)) {
  N <- N_values[i]
  se <- sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)
  lines(p, se, col = colors[i], lwd = 2)  # Add the line to the plot
}

# Add a legend to differentiate sample sizes
legend("topright", legend = paste("N =", N_values),
       col = colors, lwd = 2)

```
#7. If we are interested in the difference in proportions,  our estimate is  . Use the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the expected value of  d.

```{r}
# Set parameters
N <- 25        # Sample size
p <- 0.6       # Proportion of Democrats
B <- 10000     # Number of simulations

# Simulate B samples of size N and compute sample proportions (X̄)
X_bar <- rbinom(B, N, p) / N

# Compute d = 2 * X̄ - 1
d <- 2 * X_bar - 1

# Print simulated and theoretical expected value
cat("Simulated mean of d:", mean(d), "\n")
cat("Theoretical value (2p - 1):", 2 * p - 1, "\n")

```
#8. What is the standard error of  d?
```{r}
# Set parameters
N <- 25
p <- 0.6

# Compute standard error of d = 2 * SE(X̄)
se_d <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)

# Print result
cat("Standard error of d:", se_d, "\n")

```
#9. If the actual p=.45, it means the Republicans are winning by a relatively large margin since d=−.1, which is a 10% margin of victory. In this case, what is the standard error of 2^X−1 If we take a sample of N=25?

```{r}
# Given values
p <- 0.45
N <- 25

# Compute standard error of d = 2 * SE(X̄)
se_d <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N)

# Print the result
cat("Standard error of d when p = 0.45 and N = 25:", se_d, "\n")

```
#10 Given the answer to 9, which of the following best describes your strategy of using a sample size of  N=25?

```{r}
# Set true proportion
p <- 0.45

# Define a vector of sample sizes to test
N_values <- c(25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)

# Calculate standard error for each N
se_d_values <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / N_values)

# Print result
data.frame(Sample_Size = N_values, Standard_Error_d = round(se_d_values, 4))


#The correct choice is:
#Our standard error is larger than the difference, so the chances of 2𝑋ˉ−1. 2X−1 being positive and throwing us off were not that small. We should pick a larger sample size.
```
