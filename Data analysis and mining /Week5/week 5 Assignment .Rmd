## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Exercises

```{r}
# Load the packages needed to carry out text mining and create visual summaries
library(gutenbergr)   # Lets us download literary works from a public archive
library(dplyr)        # Supports data wrangling such as filtering and arranging
library(tidytext)     # Designed for breaking text into analyzable units
library(stringr)      # Handles tasks involving matching and modifying text
library(ggplot2)      # Allows us to visualize patterns and data insights effectively
```

```{r}
gutenberg_metadata
```
#1 Use str_detect to find the ID of the novel Pride and Prejudice.
```{r}
# Search for "Pride and Prejudice" in the title column
pride_info <- gutenberg_metadata %>%
  filter(str_detect(title, "Pride and Prejudice"))

# View results
pride_info
```
#2. We notice that there are several versions. The gutenberg_works() function filters this table to remove replicates and include only English language works. Read the help file and use this function to find the ID for Pride and Prejudice.
```{r}


# Get cleaned metadata: English language, no duplicates
cleaned_books <- gutenberg_works()

# Search for "Pride and Prejudice" in the cleaned dataset
pride_cleaned <- cleaned_books %>%
  filter(str_detect(title, "Pride and Prejudice"))

# View the results
pride_cleaned

```

#3Use the gutenberg_download function to download the text for Pride and Prejudice. Save it to an object called book.
```{r}

# Fetch the complete text of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" using its unique ID (1342) from an alternate Gutenberg mirror server
text_content <- gutenberg_download(1342, mirror = "http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/gutenberg/")
 
# Gutenberg ID 1342 uniquely identifies this classic novel. The specified mirror is used to speed up the download and reduce the load on the main server.

# Preview the beginning of the downloaded text to make sure it loaded correctly and to get a quick look at the format.
head(text_content)  
# This quick check confirms that the data has been retrieved and lets us see what the raw content looks like before processing.


```
#4Use the tidytext package to create a tidy table with all the words in the text. Save the table in an object called words
```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)

# Tokenize the text: convert lines to individual words
words <- text_content %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

# View the first few words
head(words)

```
#5We will later make a plot of sentiment versus location in the book. For this, it will be useful to add a column with the word number to the table.
```{r}
# Add a word number column to the tidy word table
words <- words %>%
  mutate(word_number = row_number())

# View the first few rows
head(words)

```
#6. Remove the stop words and numbers from the words object. Hint: use the anti_join
```{r}
# Load stop words from tidytext
data("stop_words")

# Remove stop words using anti_join
clean_words <- words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

```

#7 Now use the AFINN lexicon to assign a sentiment value to each word.
```{r}

library(tidytext)
# Load AFINN lexicon from tidytext
afinn <- get_sentiments("afinn")

# Join sentiment scores to your cleaned word list
sentiment_words <- clean_words %>%
  inner_join(afinn, by = "word")

# View result
head(sentiment_words)

```
#8 Make a plot of sentiment score versus location in the book and add a smoother.
```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Plot sentiment value over word number with a smooth trend line
ggplot(sentiment_words, aes(x = word_number, y = value)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "steelblue") +     # Light dots for each word's sentiment
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  # Smooth trend line
  labs(title = "Sentiment over the Course of Pride and Prejudice",
       x = "Word Number (Position in Book)",
       y = "AFINN Sentiment Score") +
  theme_minimal()

```
#9. Assume there are 300 words per page. Convert the locations to pages and then compute the average sentiment in each page. Plot that average score by page. Add a smoother that appears to go through data.
```{r}
# Convert word number to page (300 words per page)
sentiment_words$page <- sentiment_words$word_number %/% 300 + 1

# Calculate average sentiment per page
avg_sentiment <- sentiment_words %>%
  group_by(page) %>%
  summarise(mean_sentiment = mean(value))

# Plot average sentiment per page with smoother
ggplot(avg_sentiment, aes(x = page, y = mean_sentiment)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Sentiment by Page", x = "Page", y = "Average Sentiment")

```
