## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Exercises
#1. Load the tissue_gene_expression dataset. Remove the row means and compute the distance between each observation. Store the result in d.
```{r}
# Install and load dslabs if needed
# Only run this once
library(dslabs)
```


```{r}
# Load the tissue_gene_expression dataset
data("tissue_gene_expression")

# View the structure
str(tissue_gene_expression)

# Step 1: Access the data matrix
x <- tissue_gene_expression$x

# Step 2: Center each row by subtracting its mean
# This removes overall expression level differences per sample
x_centered <- sweep(x, 1, rowMeans(x))

# Step 3: Compute the Euclidean distances between samples (rows)
d <- dist(x_centered)

# Optional: check structure or preview
print(d)

```

#2. Make a hierarchical clustering plot and add the tissue types as labels.


```{r}
# Load required packages
library(dslabs)     # for tissue_gene_expression
library(dplyr)      # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2)    # for plotting 

# Step 1: Perform hierarchical clustering using the distance matrix
hc <- hclust(d)

# Step 2: Convert tissue types to character vector (for labeling)
labels <- as.character(tissue_gene_expression$y)

# Step 3: Plot dendrogram with tissue type labels
# Basic base R plot
plot(hc, labels = labels, main = "Hierarchical Clustering of Tissues",
     xlab = "", sub = "", cex = 0.6)  # cex adjusts label size

```
#3. Run a k-means clustering on the data with  K=7 .Make a table comparing the identified clusters to the actual tissue types. Run the algorithm several times to see how the answer changes.
```{r}
# Load libraries
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)

# Get the centered data again
x <- tissue_gene_expression$x
x_centered <- sweep(x, 1, rowMeans(x))

# Set number of clusters
k <- 7

# Run k-means clustering (set nstart for more stable results)
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility
kmeans_result <- kmeans(x_centered, centers = k, nstart = 25)

# Compare clusters to actual tissue types
table(Cluster = kmeans_result$cluster, Tissue = tissue_gene_expression$y)

```
#

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(dslabs)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Load the dataset
x <- tissue_gene_expression$x
y <- tissue_gene_expression$y

# Step 1: Select the 50 most variable genes
gene_variances <- apply(x, 2, var)
top_genes <- order(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE)[1:50]
heatmap_data <- x[, top_genes]

# Step 2: Center each gene (column-wise)
heatmap_ready <- sweep(heatmap_data, 2, colMeans(heatmap_data))

# Step 3: Assign tissue colors for each row (sample)
# Use Set1 palette for clarity
tissue_colors <- as.factor(y)
color_palette <- brewer.pal(length(levels(tissue_colors)), "Set1")
tissue_color_keys <- color_palette[tissue_colors]

# Step 4: Plot the heatmap
heatmap(heatmap_ready,
        RowSideColors = tissue_color_keys,  # Add color to show tissue type
        col = brewer.pal(11, "RdBu"),       # Color scale: low (blue) to high (red)
        main = "Top 50 Genes: Expression Clustering by Tissue",
        margins = c(6, 6))                  # Extra space for labels


```
