## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Exercise 1
# This program checks if all elements in a numeric vector are positive numbers
```{r}
# Create a numeric vector with 4 elements (1, 2, -3, 4)
# I specifically chose these values to test both cases of the if-else statement
x <- c(1, 2, -3, 4)  
# My vector containing both positive and negative numbers
# MY IF-ELSE LOGIC:
# I implemented this conditional check to verify if ALL numbers are positive
if(all(x > 0)) {  
  # Using all() function to check every element
  print("All Positives")  
} else {
  # Case when at least one number fails the positive check
  print("Not all positives") 
}

# explaination:
# I created this to practice conditional statements and vector operations in R.
#It demonstrates my understanding ofVector creation,Logical conditions,If-else control flow,The all() function

```


#Exercise 2
# We want to determine which expression is ALWAYS FALSE when
# at least one element in logical vector x is TRUE


```{r}
# Let's create test cases to evaluate each expression
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) 
# Our test vector with at least one TRUE

# 1. all(x)
# Checks if ALL elements are TRUE
# Returns TRUE only if every element is TRUE
# In our case: FALSE (because not all are TRUE)
all(x)

# 2. any(x)
# Checks if ANY element is TRUE
# Returns TRUE if at least one element is TRUE
# In our case: TRUE (we have TRUE values)
any(x)

# 3. any(!x)
# Checks if ANY element is FALSE (since ! negates)
# Returns TRUE if at least one element is FALSE
# In our case: TRUE (we have a FALSE value)
any(!x)

# 4. all(!x)
# Checks if ALL elements are FALSE (after negation)
# Returns TRUE only if every original element was FALSE
# In our case: FALSE (because we have TRUE values)
all(!x)

# Conclusion:
# all(!x) is the only expression that is:
# - FALSE when any element is TRUE
# - Only TRUE when all elements are FALSE

# Therefore, the correct answer is all(!x)
```

#Exercise 4
# Calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive)
```{r}
# code gives output of  sum of integers from 1 to n

sum_n <- function(n) {
# To  check if n is numeric (not character, logical, etc.)
# Verify n is positive (>0)
# Ensure n is an integer (no decimal places)
  if (!is.numeric(n) || n <= 0 || n != as.integer(n)) {
    stop("Input must be a positive integer")  
    # Error message for invalid input
  }
# The sum of the first n integers = n*(n + 1)/2
  sum_result <- n * (n + 1) / 2
  # RETURN RESULT
  return(sum_result)
}

#Calculate sum from 1 to 5000
result <- sum_n(5000)  
#Function call with n=5000

# FORMATTED OUTPUT
# Using format() with big.mark="," to make large numbers readable
# cat() for clean output without [1] prefix that print() would add
cat("The sum of integers from 1 to 5,000 is:", format(result, big.mark = ","), "\n")
```


```{r}
make_altman_plot <- function(x, y) {
  # Basic Altman Plot Function
  # Plots differences (x - y) against sums (x + y)
  
  # Calculate values
  differences <- x - y
  sums <- x + y
  
  # Create plot
  plot(sums, differences,
       main = "Basic Altman Plot",
       xlab = "Sum of Measurements",
       ylab = "Difference",
       pch = 24,        # Triangle point shape
       col = "blue")     # Point color
  
  # Add zero reference line
  abline(h = 0, col = "gray", lty = 2)
}

# Example usage with simple data:
make_altman_plot(c(1,2,3,4,5), c(1.1,1.9,3.2,3.8,5.1))
```

#Exercise 5
# Altman Plot Function
#Creates a simple plot to compare two measurement methods by showing their differences versus sums

```{r}
make_altman_plot <- function(x, y) {
# Compute difference between measurements (x - y)
  differences <- x - y
# Compute sum of measurements (x + y)
  sums <- x + y
  plot(sums, differences, 
# Plot differences against sums
       main = "Basic Altman Plot",  # Title
       xlab = "Sum of Measurements",  # X-axis label
       ylab = "Difference (x - y)",   # Y-axis label
       # Point styling:
       pch = 24,   
# Triangle pointing up (helps spot direction)
       col = "blue" 
# Color for visibility
  )
}
# Sample data - measurements from two methods
method_A <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)  # First measurement technique
method_B <- c(9, 16, 19, 26, 29)    # Second measurement technique
# Generate the plot
make_altman_plot(method_A, method_B)

#Visualizes plot between two measurement methods .Each point represents a pair of measurements
#X-axis (Sum): Total of both measurements → shows measurement magnitude
#Y-axis (Difference): How much the measurements differ → shows agreement

```
#Exercise 6
#To determine the final value of x:

```{r}
x <- 3                  
# Assigns value 3 to global variable x
my_func <- function(y){
#Creates a function
  x <- 5              
#Creates a LOCAL variable x (doesn't affect global x)
y+5                   
# Returns y + 5 (but doesn't change x)
}
x
#The function definition (Lines 2-4) is just stored, not executed yet
#Since we never actually call my_func(), the x <- 5 line never runs Thus, the final value of x is 3.
```
#Exercise 7
#Compute the sum of squares from 1² to n²

```{r}
compute_s_n <- function(n) {
  #Compute the sum of squares from 1² to n²
  #n Positive integer indicating upper bound of summation
  #The sum 1² + 2² + ... + n²
  # Input validation
  if (!is.numeric(n) || n <= 0 || n != as.integer(n)) {
    stop("n must be a positive integer")
  }
  # Calculate sum using the mathematical formula:
  # Sₙ = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
  sum <- n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
  return(sum)
}
# Compute the sum when n = 10
result <- compute_s_n(10)
print(paste("The sum of squares from 1² to 10² is:", result))

#Explanation:
#Mathematical Formula:Sₙ = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
#Input validation ensures n is a positive integer
#Returns the computed sum
#for n=10: 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 38
#Output:When you run this code, it will print:
 #"The sum of squares from 1² to 10² is: 385"
```
#Exercise 8
# Initialize empty numeric vector of length 25
```{r}
s_n <- vector("numeric", 25)
# Compute each Sₙ from n=1 to 25 using a for-loop
for (n in 1:25) {
  # Calculate sum of squares from 1² to n² using the formula
  s_n[n] <- n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
}
# Display the results
print(s_n)
#Explanation:
#1.Vector Initialization: vector("numeric", 25) creates an empty numeric vector with 25 elements
#2 For-loop Calculation: Loops through each integer n from 1 to 25
#3For each n, computes the sum of squares using the formula
#Stores each result in the corresponding position of s_n
#The final vector s_n contains all 25 sums:s_n[25] = 5525 (1² + 2² + ... + 25²)
```
#Exercise 9
#how to compute the sums of squares from S₁ to S₂₅ using sapply instead of a for-loop:

```{r}

# Initialize the sequence of n values from 1 to 25
n_values <- 1:25
# Use sapply to compute each Sₙ
s_n <- sapply(n_values, function(n) {
# Calculate sum of squares using the mathematical formula
  n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
})
# Display the results
print(s_n)
#Explaination
#Instead of explicitly iterating with a for-loop, we use sapply to apply the calculation to each element of n_values
#sapply: Applies the anonymous function to each element of n_values
#The output will be identical to the for-loop version 
```
#Exercise 10
# compute the sums of squares from S₁ to S₂₅ using map_dbl from the purrr package:

```{r}
# Load the purrr package
library(purrr)
# Initialize the sequence of n values from 1 to 25
n_values <- 1:25
# Use map_dbl to compute each Sₙ
s_n <- map_dbl(n_values, ~ {
# Calculate sum of squares using the mathematical formula
  .x * (.x + 1) * (2 * .x + 1) / 6
})
# Display the results
print(s_n)
#explaination
#map_dbl Specifics: Returns a numeric vector (double) by default
#Uses formula interface with ~ and .x for the input value
#Similar to sapply but with more consistent output type more explicit about expecting numeric output than sapply
#For this simple calculation, performance difference between approaches is negligible map_dbl shines in more complex mapping operations
```
#Exercise 11
# create a plot of Sₙ versus n for n = 1 to 25, using the calculated sums of squares:
```{r}
# Load required package 
library(purrr)

# Calculate Sₙ for n = 1 to 25 using map_dbl
n_values <- 1:25
s_n <- map_dbl(n_values, ~ .x * (.x + 1) * (2 * .x + 1) / 6)
# Create the plot
plot(n_values, s_n,
     main = "Sum of Squares Sₙ vs n",
     xlab = "n", 
     ylab = "Sₙ = 1² + 2² + ... + n²",
     pch = 19,        
     # Solid circles
     col = "blue",   
     # Point color
     cex = 1.2,       
     # Point size
     xlim = c(0, 25), # X-axis limits
     ylim = c(0, 6000)) # Y-axis limits
# Add connecting lines
lines(n_values, s_n, col = "gray", lty = 2)
# Add grid for better readability
grid()
# Add the mathematical formula to the plot
text(5, 4000, expression(S[n] == frac(n*(n+1)*(2*n+1), 6)), cex = 1.1)

#Explaination
#Key Features of the Plot:Blue solid circles at each (n, Sₙ) coordinate,Sized for good visibility (cex = 1.2)
#Mathematical formula displayed on plot
#Findings
#The nonlinear growth of the sum of squares and Sₙ increases rapidly with increasing n
#The characteristic cubic growth pattern (since sum of squares is O(n³))
```
#Exercise 12
#Verify Sum of Squares Calculation
```{r}
#Compares computational sum of squares against the known mathematical formula
#Sₙ = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 to validate correctness.

verify_squares <- function(n) {
  # Theoretical sum using mathematical formula
  theoretical_sum <- n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
  # Computational sum (1² + 2² + ... + n²)
  computed_sum <- sum((1:n)^2)
  # Compare with tolerance for floating point precision
  isTRUE(all.equal(computed_sum, theoretical_sum))
}
# Implementation of sum_square_values for completeness
sum_square_values <- function(n) {
  sum((1:n)^2)
}
# Test cases
print(verify_squares(10))  # TRUE
print(verify_squares(25))  # TRUE 
print(verify_squares(100)) # TRUE
#Uses all.equal() instead of identical() to handle floating point precisio

# Verify for specific values
verify_squares(5)   # TRUE (1+4+9+16+25 = 55)
verify_squares(100) # TRUE

```
