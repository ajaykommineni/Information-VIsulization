This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
# loading the tidyverse package
data() 
# displays the list of data sets available in R
glimpse(msleep)
# provides a quick overview of the data set
head(msleep) 
# prints the first 6 rows of data set
```

```{r}
# with respective variable(awake)
min(msleep$awake) 
# gets the minimum of awake variable
max(msleep$awake) 
# gets the maximum of awake variable
range(msleep$awake) 
# gets the range of values
IQR(msleep$awake) 
# gets the interquartile range of awake variable
mean(msleep$awake) 
# calculating mean of awake variable
median(msleep$awake) 
# calculating median of awake variable
var(msleep$awake) 
# calculating Variance of awake variable
```
```{r}
# Displaying summary of dataframe msleep
summary(msleep)
# Displays summary of one variable in a single row
summary(msleep$sleep_total) 
```
```{r}
# from data set selecting two variable and summarizing
msleep %>%
  # selecting two variables from msleep and using pipe operator displaying summary
  select(sleep_total,brainwt) %>% 
  summary #getting the summary
```

```{r}
# A summary table is created for vore values
# showing the min, max, and the difference and arranging data set by the average
msleep %>%
  drop_na(vore) %>% 
  # drops the missing values
  group_by(vore) %>% 
  # grouping by vore variable
  summarise(
    # finding the measures and assigning new reference for summarizing
    Lower = min(sleep_total), 
    # min of sleep_total
    Average = mean(sleep_total), 
    #mean of sleep_total
    Upper = max(sleep_total),
    # max of sleep_total
    Difference = max(sleep_total) - min(sleep_total)
    # difference in max and min of sleep total 
    ) %>%
  arrange(Average) 
# arranges data set according to Average
```
```{r}
# creating contingency tables
library(MASS) # loading the mass package
attach(Cars93) # can apply base R functions on data set Cars93
glimpse(Cars93) # displays quick overview of the dataset

# table () for the variable Origin
table(Origin) 
# summary of origin of cars displays

# table() for multiple variables
table(AirBags, Origin)
```


```{r}
# keeping the above table function to the addmargins()
addmargins(table(AirBags,Origin),1)
# 1 in the end of the function sums the rows
addmargins(table(AirBags,Origin),2)
#If there is 2 in the end it sums up the columns
```


```{r}
table(AirBags, Origin) 
# generates contingency table of AirBags and Origin
prop.table(table(AirBags, Origin)) 
# Calculate the proportion of AirBags and Origin
prop.table(table(AirBags, Origin))*100 
# converting proportions to percentages by multiplying previous with 100
round(prop.table(table(AirBags, Origin), 2)*100)
# round the percentage proportions to two decimal places for precision
```

```{r}
#it gets messy to avoid that Greg suggested to use tidyverse with the pipe operators
#Below is the example for same
Cars93 %>%
  group_by(Origin, AirBags) %>% 
  # groups by Origin and AirBags
  summarise(number = n()) %>% 
  # Summarizes the data by count of number of occurrences
  #pivot the data wider function selects the names from a origin variable
  #and values from number variable
  pivot_wider(names_from = Origin,
              values_from = number)
