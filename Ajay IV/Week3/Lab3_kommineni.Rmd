This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
# loads the tidyverse library
library(ggplot2) 
# loads the ggplot2 package frim tidyverse library
data() 
# lists all the data sets built in R in new tab 
?BOD 
# data dictionary of BOD data set like description
#this gives info about BOD in the bottam right section
```
```{r}
# plotting the graph
ggplot(data = BOD,
       # choosing BOD as data
       mapping = aes(x = Time, 
                     y = demand))+ 
  #setting x and y axes with time and demand respectively
  geom_point(size = 5) + 
  # adding points with size of 5
  geom_line(color = "blue")
# adds  color line to the points
# As time passes demand increases with slight decrease

```
```{r}
# plotting the graph
# in the below command it didn't specify the data and mapping beacuse ggplot 
# it automatically takes first two arugments as data and mapping

ggplot(BOD, aes(Time, demand))+ 
  # Assigning directly the data set, x and y axes.
  geom_point(size = 3)+ 
  # adding points with size of 3
  geom_line(colour = "green") 
# adds  color line to the points
```


```{r}

  # different panels are created for every plant depending on 'Type'
  labs(title = "Concentration of CO2")+ # title to graph
  theme_bw()
# setting the black and white theme
# It shows that as concentration of CO2 increases, CO2 uptake usually increases.
# Additionally, nonchilled plants exhibit higher uptake rates compared to chilled plants.
# This is evident from the partitioning of trend lines within each panel.
```



```{r}
