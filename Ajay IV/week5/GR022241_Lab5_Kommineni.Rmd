#Findings
#Generally speaking, cars with higher mileage (better fuel efficiency) are typically less expensive. Given that fuel-efficient vehicles are frequently less expensive, this is to be expected.
#The Tesla Model S, are electric vehicles they have  high pricing and high mileage.
#Vehicles such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry are grouped in the middle of the price and mileage ranges, they have good fuel economy.

#Findings
# Most cars have a mileage of between 25 and 40 miles per gallon, The 30-35 MPG range has the largest frequency of cars, suggesting that this is the dataset's most prevalent fuel economy level.Extreme instances are represented by a small number of cars with extremely low mileage (less than 15 MPG) or extremely high mileage (more than 45 MPG).
