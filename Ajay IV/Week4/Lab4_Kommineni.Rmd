?msleep # to know more about the msleep data set 
glimpse(msleep)
# Variable is renamed
msleep %>% 
  rename("conserv" = "conservation") 
# rename() function is to rename names of variables of rows or columns
head(msleep) 
# prints first few rows of the renamed table

```



```{r}
# Reorder variables
msleep %>% 
 select(vore,name,everything()) 
#  Selects the columns 'vore', 'name'
#everything is used to select  all other columns

#chnaging varaible type
class(msleep$vore) 
# shows the class of vore varaible in dataser msleep
msleep$vore <- as.factor(msleep$vore) 
# converting it into a factor

# there is another way to change the varaible name 
msleep %>%
  mutate(vore = as.character(vore)) %>% 
  # again chnaging  variable to character

##  Bar charts and Histograms using ggplot in R with Greg Martin
```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
?msleep 
# displays the info about the dataframe
head(msleep) # gets the top few rows
```


```{r}

msleep %>% 
  drop_na(vore) %>% 
  # drops missing values in vore
  ggplot(aes(x=vore))+ 
  # useing ggplot and mapping  vore to x axis
  geom_bar(fill="#97B3C6")+ 
  # creates a bar plot and assigns the filler
  theme_bw()+ 
  # sets black and white theme
  labs(x = "Vore", 
       # labeling the x axis
       y = NULL,
       # labeling the y-axis as null
       title = "Number of observations per order") 
# adds the title
# This plot gives the count in a bar graph according to carni, herbi, insects and omnivores
#If the bars are uneven, it suggests that some categories have more species recorded than others.
# The plot displays the count of various dietary categories ('vore') in the data set. Herbivores ('herbi') have the highest count (over 30), followed by 'carni' and 'omni', with each around 20. 
#Insectivores have the lowest count, below 5.
#With a much taller bar, it means that most of the recorded species in the dataset belong to herbi.

```


```{r}
# created a barplot 
msleep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(awake)) + 
  # Using ggplot with aesthetics mapping to awake
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#97B3C6")+ 
  # creates histogram with bindwidth = 1 and fills the repective color 
  theme_bw()+ 
  # sets black and white theme
  labs(x = "Total Sleep", 
       y = NULL, 
       title = "Histogram of total sleep") 

#The histogram helps identify how sleep duration varies among different species.
# The plot shows the allocation of total sleep time in the `msleep` dataset. 
#The data shows multiple peaks, indicating variations in sleep duration across numerous species.
#If most bars are clustered to the left (low awake hours), it suggests that many species sleep a lot.
#Peaks indicate common sleep time  among species.
